== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who is this plugin for? =

Target audience of this plugin is mainly theme developers who are willing to create a portfolio theme or want to add portfolio functionality to an existing one.

= How is this plugin different from Jetpack portfolio module and other plugins that basically do the same thing?

This plugin is actually inspired by Jetpack portfolio module and Portfolio Post Type by Devin Price and Gary Jones. However, unlike those plugins, Portfolio Toolkit is built with WordPress Plugin Boilerplate by Tom Mcfarlin, which utilises a slightly different approach in building plugins. This doesn't mean that those plugins are better or worse.

On top of that, Portfolio Toolkit adds custom meta boxes to each portfolio project.

= What meta boxes are included? =

There are three meta boxes at the moment: 'Project client', 'Project release date', 'Project URL'. See screenshot.

= Does this plugin include any templates? =

No, it doesn't. However, you can easily create your own in your theme(or child theme).

= Does this plugin available on Github? =

Absolutely. You are welcome to report issues and submit pull requests.
